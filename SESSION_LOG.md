# SESSION_LOG.md — GESTALT project

Running progress log. Newest first.

## 2026-07-26 — Nervous System (13th document): sensing, cognition, comms

- **New 13th document — Nervous System** (`gestalt-nervous.html`): how a grown
  vessel senses, thinks, controls and communicates. Its thesis: a km-scale ship
  needs both a **grown "wet" nervous system** (real sensory organs, bioelectric
  signalling, grown neural computation — DishBrain-style) for sensing,
  homeostasis, reflex and learning, and a **fabricated "dry" silicon core** (fast
  deterministic compute, navigation, comms, the human digital interface) —
  because biology can't grow a fast transistor or a radio, and silicon can't
  self-repair or sense. The two are joined by a real bio-electronic **interface**
  (OECTs, microelectrode arrays, electrogenetics, optogenetics, conductive
  nanowires). It is, honestly, a cyborg. Covers senses, the signalling
  speed-limit, the four kinds of organic computation, the silicon side & the
  interface, communication (crew + fleet), and a worked docking control loop.
  Three house-style figures (control stack, bio-electronic interface, docking
  loop), 14 citations. Registered in the catalog (slug `nervous`); canonical nav
  regenerated to **thirteen** entries across every document; all thirteen
  artifacts republished.

## 2026-07-26 — Python simulations of the designs' major systems (animated 3D)

- **New `sim/` package**: dependency-light Python (numpy + matplotlib) that
  models the major systems of the four main designs and renders them as
  **animated 3D GIFs** (`assets/sim/`). Modular — `params.py` (canonical
  numbers, single source of truth), `systems.py` (grounded dynamics: growth,
  life support, spin gravity, thermal, gestation), `geometry.py` (3D meshes),
  `animate.py` (per-design 3D-scene-plus-gauge builders), `run.py` (CLI:
  `python -m sim.run [design] [--fast] [--check]`).
- **Four simulations**, each a 3D scene + live gauges: **NAVIS** grows from a
  seed to ~24,000 t on the mining-limited curve with day/night intima glow;
  **ARCA** spins to 1 g at the rim with crew on the inner surface, a Coriolis
  drop, and a stable ~125-yr O₂ reserve; **LICHEN** swings ~160–265 K on the
  Martian surface while the interior holds 293 K; **GRAVID** gestates vessels in
  staggered cradle cycles. Each verified by eye from a rendered frame.
- Added `sim/INTERFACE.md`, a README "Simulations" section (the four GIFs), the
  project INTERFACE tree, and a gitignore for the preview frames.

## 2026-07-26 — Metabolism (12th document): ingest → digest → metabolise → excrete

- **New 12th document — Metabolism** (`gestalt-metabolism.html`): the nutrition-
  and-waste physiology of a grown vessel across four acts. Python-grounded
  mass-and-energy budget yields the document's thesis: photosynthesis on the hull
  makes only ~0.45 t/day of biomass (matching 13 t/day growth would need 29× the
  hull area), so the intima only makes the crew's **air** — the **body** is grown
  by *eating the rock* (digesting a carbonaceous asteroid's reduced organic
  carbon, ~1.4 MW, and oxidising its minerals), which is why growth is
  mining-limited. Covers the two mouths, the mineral gut (bioleaching →
  separation → refinery → organics → absorption), the two-sap bloodstream, and
  the four waste streams (only heat truly leaves; ~100 t/day tailings re-used as
  shielding; C/H₂O/N closed). Five house-style figures (whole-body flow,
  ingestion, digestive tract, energy budget, excretion streams), 13 citations.
  Registered in the catalog (slug `metabolism`); canonical nav regenerated to
  **twelve** entries across every document and all twelve artifacts republished.
  (Recovered mid-build from a botched in-place figure swap by rebuilding the doc
  from source and re-injecting figures cleanly.)

## 2026-07-26 — Cell Atlas (11th document) + richer 3D interiors

- **New 11th document — the Cell Atlas** (`gestalt-cells.html`): a cell-level
  cytology of a grown vessel. Grounds the census in Python (~10¹⁹ cells per
  hull; ~42 distinct types across 8 functional classes) and catalogues every
  type — role, survival, chassis, metabolism, life-cycle, coordination and
  distribution — plus the internal ecosystem/trophic web, and how each type is
  engineered, grown and tested (cross-linked to the Compendium and Earth
  Program). Three new house-style figures (lineage tree, trophic web, hull
  cell-distribution map), 19 citations, honest `gap:` flags on the three big
  integration bets. Registered in the viewer catalog (slug `cells`); the
  canonical nav is regenerated to **eleven** entries across every document and
  all eleven artifacts republished.
- **3D models — richer cutaway interiors**: multi-level decks, habitation
  compartments, vascular cores, ARCA terraces/settlements/sun-cord nodes,
  LICHEN floors + taproot, GRAVID embryos at two growth stages with umbilicals,
  and SPORE/LEVIATHAN/TESTUDO occupants. All 14 builds node-verified.

## 2026-07-26 — Detailed illustrated README (+ a broken figure found & fixed)

- **Rewrote `README.md`** into a detailed, illustrated guide: hero, a mermaid program
  map + closed-loop-metabolism diagram, a per-document tour with real figures, a
  "by the numbers" table (python-verified), the honesty conventions, and run/structure
  sections.
- **Extracted 13 figures** straight from the documents' own inline SVGs into
  `assets/figures/` as PNGs. Each figure is made self-contained (the docs' CSS
  variables are resolved to literal dark-theme values, since librsvg does not evaluate
  `var()`; stray `&` escaped; a dark ground added) and rasterised with `rsvg-convert`,
  then eyeballed. Class-styled drawing sheets (Starship/Habitat/GRAVID/LICHEN) carry
  their doc's class rules so they render faithfully.
- **Found and fixed a real defect:** the Compendium's *defence-in-depth* cancer-control
  figure was an unfilled `{fig}` placeholder in the published doc. Rebuilt it from
  scratch as a python-grounded waterfall (10¹² → 0.1 uncontrolled tumour lineages
  across seven layered controls, ~10¹³× suppression, below the 1-per-lifetime
  threshold) and republished the Compendium.

## 2026-07-26 — Two new documents, consistency pass + GitHub

- **Grew to ten documents.** Added the **Fleet Class Reference**
  (`gestalt-classref.html`, 9th) — a detailed profile of all 18 grown-vehicle
  classes with a master comparison table — and **3D Models** (`gestalt-3d.html`,
  10th) — interactive, rotatable/zoomable solid models of all seven main forms,
  drawn by a self-contained (WebGL-free) software renderer with cutaway views,
  interior components, a live scale bar and labelled hotspots.
- **Consistency pass across all 10 docs.** The per-document navigation bars had
  drifted (each listed a different 5–8 subset of the set). Regenerated every
  `prog-nav` to one canonical 10-entry bar so all documents cross-link the whole
  program; verified 9 links + 1 current marker and balanced tags in each.
  Re-published all ten artifacts to their canonical URLs. Updated `README.md`,
  `INTERFACE.md`, and `viewer/catalog.py` to reflect ten documents.
- **Published the project to GitHub** (`git init` + first commit).

## 2026-07-26 — Persisted to project folder + Python viewer

- Copied all eight published documents from the (session-only) scratchpad into
  `docs/`, plus the design-loop state file `deepen-roadmap.md`.
- Built a zero-dependency **Python viewer** (`viewer/`, stdlib only):
  - `catalog.py` — document registry (source of truth).
  - `wrap.py` — wraps each artifact fragment into standalone HTML and rewrites
    cross-document `claude.ai/code/artifact/<id>` links to local `/d/<slug>`
    routes (preserving `#anchors`).
  - `index.py` — themed landing page (document grid, GESTALT identity, light/dark).
  - `app.py` — `http.server` app + CLI (`--check`, `--open`, `-p`).
  - Verified: `--check` passes for all 8 docs + index; live server returns 200 for
    `/` and `/d/<slug>`, 404 for unknown slugs; 0 residual external artifact links
    after rewriting.
- Added `INTERFACE.md`, `README.md`, and this log.

## Program state (design loop)

The documents are produced and refined by a recurring "deepening" design loop
whose full round-by-round history and queue live in `deepen-roadmap.md`.

- **Phase A** (rounds 1–20): deepen each document element; ground every figure
  in Python. Complete.
- **Phase B** (rounds 21–30): build the Earth Program (ground R&D roadmap) —
  six work packages, integration ladder, Gantt + budget, gated go/no-go. Complete.
- **Phase C** (rounds 31–44): cross-link all documents bidirectionally; audit and
  reconcile every figure against the Compendium §08 canonical-parameters table.
  Caught and fixed several real errors (ARCA atmosphere 828→113 Mt and its O₂-buffer
  cascade; LICHEN membrane 6.5→7.4 MN/m; the pressure-wall 6.5 cm→6.5 mm; the O₂
  buffer 160→140 yr to match the canonical 34% O₂; stale cross-doc phrasing).
- **Phase D**: upgrade all figures to professional architectural-diagram
  standard, and add real citations throughout (~108 references across the set).
- **Phase E** (user-directed): subsystem deep-dives (light delivery, healing &
  regeneration, sustainability) documented as chat answers + python-grounded
  figures; the **Fleet Class Reference** and interactive **3D Models** documents;
  and a whole-program consistency + cross-linking pass. Program now ten documents.
