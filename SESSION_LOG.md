# SESSION_LOG.md — GESTALT project

Running progress log. Newest first.

## 2026-07-26 — Cell Atlas (11th document) + richer 3D interiors

- **New 11th document — the Cell Atlas** (`gestalt-cells.html`): a cell-level
  cytology of a grown vessel. Grounds the census in Python (~10¹⁹ cells per
  hull; ~42 distinct types across 8 functional classes) and catalogues every
  type — role, survival, chassis, metabolism, life-cycle, coordination and
  distribution — plus the internal ecosystem/trophic web, and how each type is
  engineered, grown and tested (cross-linked to the Compendium and Earth
  Program). Three new house-style figures (lineage tree, trophic web, hull
  cell-distribution map), 19 citations, honest `gap:` flags on the three big
  integration bets. Registered in the viewer catalog (slug `cells`); the
  canonical nav is regenerated to **eleven** entries across every document and
  all eleven artifacts republished.
- **3D models — richer cutaway interiors**: multi-level decks, habitation
  compartments, vascular cores, ARCA terraces/settlements/sun-cord nodes,
  LICHEN floors + taproot, GRAVID embryos at two growth stages with umbilicals,
  and SPORE/LEVIATHAN/TESTUDO occupants. All 14 builds node-verified.

## 2026-07-26 — Detailed illustrated README (+ a broken figure found & fixed)

- **Rewrote `README.md`** into a detailed, illustrated guide: hero, a mermaid program
  map + closed-loop-metabolism diagram, a per-document tour with real figures, a
  "by the numbers" table (python-verified), the honesty conventions, and run/structure
  sections.
- **Extracted 13 figures** straight from the documents' own inline SVGs into
  `assets/figures/` as PNGs. Each figure is made self-contained (the docs' CSS
  variables are resolved to literal dark-theme values, since librsvg does not evaluate
  `var()`; stray `&` escaped; a dark ground added) and rasterised with `rsvg-convert`,
  then eyeballed. Class-styled drawing sheets (Starship/Habitat/GRAVID/LICHEN) carry
  their doc's class rules so they render faithfully.
- **Found and fixed a real defect:** the Compendium's *defence-in-depth* cancer-control
  figure was an unfilled `{fig}` placeholder in the published doc. Rebuilt it from
  scratch as a python-grounded waterfall (10¹² → 0.1 uncontrolled tumour lineages
  across seven layered controls, ~10¹³× suppression, below the 1-per-lifetime
  threshold) and republished the Compendium.

## 2026-07-26 — Two new documents, consistency pass + GitHub

- **Grew to ten documents.** Added the **Fleet Class Reference**
  (`gestalt-classref.html`, 9th) — a detailed profile of all 18 grown-vehicle
  classes with a master comparison table — and **3D Models** (`gestalt-3d.html`,
  10th) — interactive, rotatable/zoomable solid models of all seven main forms,
  drawn by a self-contained (WebGL-free) software renderer with cutaway views,
  interior components, a live scale bar and labelled hotspots.
- **Consistency pass across all 10 docs.** The per-document navigation bars had
  drifted (each listed a different 5–8 subset of the set). Regenerated every
  `prog-nav` to one canonical 10-entry bar so all documents cross-link the whole
  program; verified 9 links + 1 current marker and balanced tags in each.
  Re-published all ten artifacts to their canonical URLs. Updated `README.md`,
  `INTERFACE.md`, and `viewer/catalog.py` to reflect ten documents.
- **Published the project to GitHub** (`git init` + first commit).

## 2026-07-26 — Persisted to project folder + Python viewer

- Copied all eight published documents from the (session-only) scratchpad into
  `docs/`, plus the design-loop state file `deepen-roadmap.md`.
- Built a zero-dependency **Python viewer** (`viewer/`, stdlib only):
  - `catalog.py` — document registry (source of truth).
  - `wrap.py` — wraps each artifact fragment into standalone HTML and rewrites
    cross-document `claude.ai/code/artifact/<id>` links to local `/d/<slug>`
    routes (preserving `#anchors`).
  - `index.py` — themed landing page (document grid, GESTALT identity, light/dark).
  - `app.py` — `http.server` app + CLI (`--check`, `--open`, `-p`).
  - Verified: `--check` passes for all 8 docs + index; live server returns 200 for
    `/` and `/d/<slug>`, 404 for unknown slugs; 0 residual external artifact links
    after rewriting.
- Added `INTERFACE.md`, `README.md`, and this log.

## Program state (design loop)

The documents are produced and refined by a recurring "deepening" design loop
whose full round-by-round history and queue live in `deepen-roadmap.md`.

- **Phase A** (rounds 1–20): deepen each document element; ground every figure
  in Python. Complete.
- **Phase B** (rounds 21–30): build the Earth Program (ground R&D roadmap) —
  six work packages, integration ladder, Gantt + budget, gated go/no-go. Complete.
- **Phase C** (rounds 31–44): cross-link all documents bidirectionally; audit and
  reconcile every figure against the Compendium §08 canonical-parameters table.
  Caught and fixed several real errors (ARCA atmosphere 828→113 Mt and its O₂-buffer
  cascade; LICHEN membrane 6.5→7.4 MN/m; the pressure-wall 6.5 cm→6.5 mm; the O₂
  buffer 160→140 yr to match the canonical 34% O₂; stale cross-doc phrasing).
- **Phase D**: upgrade all figures to professional architectural-diagram
  standard, and add real citations throughout (~108 references across the set).
- **Phase E** (user-directed): subsystem deep-dives (light delivery, healing &
  regeneration, sustainability) documented as chat answers + python-grounded
  figures; the **Fleet Class Reference** and interactive **3D Models** documents;
  and a whole-program consistency + cross-linking pass. Program now ten documents.
